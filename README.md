# FaQ:
- *What if I don't have access to the console?*

***You can download another Application to inject the console. [Universal Unreal Engine 4 Unlocker](https://framedsc.com/GeneralGuides/universal_ue4_consoleunlocker.htm).***

- *I have access to the console but the App doesn't work.*

***You can try to manually set it by typing in*** '***FOV*** *5-175*'***.***

- *Does this support any other Unreal Engine Versions besides UE4?*

***As long as you have access to the console, and the FOV command or it's supported by the Engine version.***
